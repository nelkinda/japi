Feature: CSV Editor

  Background:
    Given I have just started the csvEditor.

  Scenario: As a <User>, I want to <start the csvEditor> in order to <use it>
    Then the table name must be "<Unnamed>",
    And the csvEditor MUST have focus,
    And the table MUST be empty,
    And the window title MUST be "CSV Editor: <Unnamed>"

  Scenario: As a <User>, I want to <quit the editor> in order to <stop using it>
    When I wait for action "quit",
    Then the window is disposed.

  Scenario: As a <User>, I want to <insert a new column> in an empty table
    Then the csvEditor MUST have focus,
    When I wait for action "columnInsertAfter",
    Then the table content MUST be:
      | Unnamed_A |
    When I wait for action "columnInsertAfter",
    Then the table content MUST be:
      | Unnamed_A | Unnamed_B |
    When I wait for action "columnInsertAfter",
    Then the table content MUST be:
      | Unnamed_A | Unnamed_B | Unnamed_C |

  Scenario: As a <User>, I want to <delete a column> in a non-empty table
    Then the csvEditor MUST have focus,
    When I wait for action "columnInsertAfter",
    Then the table content MUST be:
      | Unnamed_A |
    When I wait for action "columnDelete",
    Then the table MUST be empty,
